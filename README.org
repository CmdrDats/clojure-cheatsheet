** Basic Usage
   
Call =M-x clojure-cheatsheet= and the cheatsheet will appear. Type
in some terms (space separated) to narrow down the list.


*** Keys

| =C-n= | Next item                                        |
| =C-p= | Previous item                                    |
| =C-o= | Next section                                     |
| =RET= | View the Clojure docs for the current selection. |
| =TAB= | View alternative actions.                        |

** Advanced Usage

This package stands on top of Helm. The variable
=helm-source-clojure-cheatsheet= is available if you want to mix it in
as a Helm source.

If you're hooked up to [[http://melpa.milkbox.net/][MELPA]]:

M-x package-install RET clojure-cheatsheet

Alternatively just grab the single =clojure-cheatsheet.el= file and
install that in your preferred way.
